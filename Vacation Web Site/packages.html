    <h1> Portugals Beautiful Desinations </h1>
    <p> Top 8 Desinations to stay while traveling to Portugal</p>
     
    <h2> Lisbon, Portugal </h2>
        
        <div class="gallery">

                <img src="images/lisb.jpg" alt=" Lisbon, Portugal"

        </div>
        <p>
            Up to 30 years ago, this historic capital city was in varying states of disrepair, but today, thanks to a robust revitalization, this is one of Europe’s most charismatic and vibrant cities. Colorful azulejos (ceramic tiles) glisten in its sun-drenched streets as vintage trams rattle up hills. Spectacular sunsets over the city’s red-tiled roofs are cause for saudade—the Portuguese word for a feeling of yearning and nostalgia—which travelers will feel on their return home.
    
            Lisbon is a walker’s delight, so meander through the cobblestone streets to its miradouros—lookout points to take in the city’s views—spread across its seven hills facing the Tagus River. Take the tram to Belém to marvel at Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, and reward your efforts with a delicious Pastéis de Belém, the original pastel de nata (egg custard tart).
    
            Wander through the tangled alleyways of Alfama, where the traditional Portuguese music genre called fado was born. Stop into the Museu do Fado,and linger in the area for a sardine supper and Fado show at one of the many restaurants in this district.

        <p>
            Overlooking the Douro River, Porto is known for its stately bridges, port wine production, and dizzying viewpoints above terra-cotta rooftops. Once a trade village, Porto is now enjoying the fruits of ongoing development with cool cafés, wine bars, and new cultural offerings that reflect the city’s vibrant energy.
            
            Popular sights include the medieval Ribeira district, a UNESCO World Heritage site, where tourists admire the atmosphere. Walk across the city’s iconic Ponte de Dom Luis I bridge to Vila Nova de Gaia to sip a glass of port, then catch a spectacular sunset at Jardim do Morro. Walk on the sea-facing promenade in Foz de Douro, admire the gilded interiors of the 15th-century São Francisco Church, and stop into the 2020-opened WOW (World of Wine), a sprawling complex of museums, restaurants, and bars near the river.

            <p>
                For greener pastures, look to the rolling hills of the Douro Valley, one of the world’s oldest and best-known demarcated wine regions, dating back to 1756. Famed for its terraced vineyards, with vines ribbing the contours of steep granite slopes, this valley is the birthplace of port.
                
                You can take a languid boat ride (six–seven hours) from Porto to get here, but the best way to experience the region is to rent a car and visit Quinta do Noval and other wine-growing estates, known as quintas. Most offer public tours with winetastings.
                
                Where to stay

            <p> Portugal’s vinho verde hails from this verdant region of vineyard-covered valleys and towns frozen in time. Braga, one of Portugal’s oldest cities, has many baroque churches, and its old center brims with cafés, traditional Portuguese restaurants, and plazas.
    
                A highlight of this region is Peneda-Gerês, one of the world’s few temperate rain forests, which borders Spain. You’ll need a car to head here, and while the curvy roads might make your stomach drop at times, the vistas are well worth the trek: The mountainous terrain with thick woods is punctuated by swift rivers, streams, and waterfalls. Canoe or hike, and meander through the region’s medieval castles or monasteries, which are well integrated into the landscape.

            <p> A striking cathedral, cloisters, and the columns of the Templo Romano (near Roman baths) sit inside Évora’s 14th-century walls. Romans began inhabiting the city in the 2nd century B.C.E., and many ruins—including the Temple of Diana—remain, along with palaces and convents built by later occupants, including the Moors and Portuguese royalty. Évora was deemed a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986, and the European Commission has designated it as 2027’s European capital of culture.
                
                Tip: An experience travelers shouldn’t miss in this preserved medieval town is a soak in the serene Roman bath In Acqua Veritas.

            <p> Portuguese royals used to spend their summers in Sintra, and it’s easy to see why.

It’s also a vibrant university town, with one of Europe’s oldest schools, the University of Coimbra, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Brightly coloured moliceiros (traditional boats) float on its waters, and the city offers art nouveau buildings like the Cathedral of Aveiro and the Museu de Aveiro.
