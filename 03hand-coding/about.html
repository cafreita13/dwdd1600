<h1> About </h1>
<h2> Meet the Pastry Chef</h2>
<p> Let me introduce myself... Hi, my name is Carli Collins. I first started baking as a hobby as a kid, then worked in several kitchen & bakery settings gaining experience. 
    Now I am sharing the tips and tricks I have learned along the way to help make baking an easy and fun experience with everyone.
